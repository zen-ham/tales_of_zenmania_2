[![ ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_Source_Week-white?logo=opensourceinitiative)](https://github.com/zen-ham#-) day 3 release!

I did not name this game! The name is a coincidence.

This is a simple little text adventure game. The game has 112 choices and 44 different endings, at any time you can also submit '?' and any recent keywords will be explained.
the side goal of this game is to be somewhat educational, so use ? as often as you want and you'll probably learn something!

I created this because I played the namesake of this game that was made by a friend a few years ago and released recently, [tales of zenmania](https://github.com/Ubuntufanboy/tales-of-zenmania) 1. This is a far expanded version.

Yes, the plot was created with help AI, the code itself was not. Forgive me but I didn't have the desire to write thousands of lines of story and definitions :). I don't think the game suffers from it tho.

if you want to play the game but don't have python, download the version I packaged with pyinstaller, tales_of_zenmania_2.exe
